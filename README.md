# unit-4-game
## What it does:
* Randomly generates a goal number from 20-120
* Randomly generates a number from 1-12 for each image
* When an image is clicked, your score goes up by that number
* If the goal number is reached, you win. If you go over, you lose.
* Keeps a running total of wins and losses
* After a win or a loss, the game resets and the numbers all re-randomize.
